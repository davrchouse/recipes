Bourbon Walnut Pie

Ma’s foolproof pie crust:

1 & 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp. sugar
3/4 of a stick cold unsalted butter, cut in ¼ inch slices
1/4 cup cold Crisco shortening, cut in 4 pieces
1/8 cup vodka
1/8 cup cold water


Process 2/3 cup flour, salt and sugar in food
processor (about 2 pulses). Add butter and
shortening and process until homogeneous
dough starts to collect in clumps (about 15
seconds). Dough will resemble cottage
cheese curds.
Scrape bowl with rubber spatula to distribute
evenly around the blade. Add remaining
flour and process with 4 to 6 quick pulses.
Empty mixture into medium bowl.
Sprinkle ice cold vodka and water over
mixture. With spatula use a folding motion to
mix, pressing down on dough until it is
slightly tacky and sticks together.
Flatten into a 4 inch disk. Wrap in plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes
or up to 2 days.


Walnut bourbon filling:

1 cup dark corn syrup
1/2 cup sugar
3 large eggs
2 Tbsp. (¼ stick) unsalted butter, melted
2 Tbsp. bourbon
1 & 1/2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/4 tsp. salt
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup walnut halves

Preheat oven to 350. Whisk syrup, sugar,
eggs, butter, bourbon, flour, vanilla and salt
in a large bowl. Mix in all walnuts.
Roll out dough on a floured surface to 14
inch round. Transfer to a 9 inch glass pie
dish. Fold edge under rim and crimp decoratively.
Pour filling into unbaked dough.
Bake until crust is golden and filling is set
in the center when pie is shaken slightly,
about 55 minutes. Cool pie completely on a
rack before serving.
